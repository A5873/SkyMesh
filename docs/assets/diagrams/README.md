# SkyMesh Technical Diagrams

This directory contains technical diagrams for the SkyMesh project in SVG format. These diagrams illustrate the key components and architecture of the satellite system, ground station, and software stack.

## Diagram Files

- `satellite_hardware_layout.svg` - Block diagram showing the 3U CubeSat layout with all major subsystems
- `communication_system_diagram.svg` - Detailed diagram of UHF/VHF and S-band communication systems
- `power_subsystem_diagram.svg` - Solar panels, batteries, and power distribution layout
- `mechanical_layout.svg` - Physical 3U CubeSat design with dimensions
- `ground_station_architecture.svg` - Ground station components and connections
- `satellite_os_architecture.svg` - OS architecture with kernel, drivers, and services

## Usage Guidelines

- All diagrams follow the SkyMesh color scheme (#1E88E5, #0F1C2E, #FFC107)
- Diagrams are maintained as SVG files for scalability and easy editing
- When embedding in documents, use relative paths (e.g., `../assets/diagrams/filename.svg`)
- PNG exports may be created for compatibility but should be regenerated when SVGs change
