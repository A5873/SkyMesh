# SkyMesh Networking

This directory contains the source code for the mesh networking components of the SkyMesh system.

## Overview

The SkyMesh networking layer enables reliable, secure communication between satellites in the orbital layer and with ground stations. It implements specialized routing algorithms optimized for the unique constraints of orbital mechanics and the dynamic topology of the constellation.

## Features

- Dynamic mesh routing protocols
- Delay/disruption tolerant networking (DTN)
- Quality of service management
- Bandwidth optimization
- End-to-end encryption
- Store-and-forward capabilities
- Congestion control

## Directory Structure

- `/protocols` - Core networking protocols implementation
- `/routing` - Routing algorithms and topology management
- `/security` - Cryptographic libraries and security protocols
- `/testing` - Simulation and testing tools

## Development

See the main project README.md for development setup instructions.
