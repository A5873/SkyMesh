# SkyMesh: Decentralized Orbital Mesh Network

SkyMesh is a decentralized orbital mesh network composed of low-cost nano-satellites, each powered by radiation-tolerant single-board computers running a custom lightweight satellite OS. These CubeSat-class devices operate in low Earth orbit and act as dynamic uplink nodes, relays, and observers, forming an autonomous, reconfigurable communication layer in space.

Paired with open-source ground gateways and uplink stations, SkyMesh enables:
- Censorship-resistant data exchange
- Emergency communication networks
- Remote IoT relay capabilities
- Decentralized internet fallback infrastructure

Designed with modular hardware and a real-time-capable OS optimized for mesh networking and power efficiency, SkyMesh bridges the Earth and orbit with a peer-to-peer ethos‚Äîturning the sky into a sovereign digital space.

## Core Features

- üõ∞Ô∏è **Orbital Mesh Network**: Dynamic satellite-to-satellite communication
- üîí **Radiation-Hardened Design**: Triple Modular Redundancy and error correction
- üì° **Multi-Band Communication**: UHF/VHF for control, S-band for high-speed data
- üåê **Open Protocol**: Community-driven mesh networking standards
- üîã **Efficient Power Management**: Adaptive power control and optimization
- üõ°Ô∏è **Autonomous Operation**: Self-healing network with minimal ground control

## Development Status

**Current Status**: Early Development / Prototype Phase

SkyMesh is currently in the early development and prototype design phase. I am working on system architecture, simulation tools, and proof-of-concept implementations for the core components.

## Quick Start Guide

## Architecture Overview

The SkyMesh architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Orbital Layer**: A constellation of CubeSat-class nanosatellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), forming a dynamic mesh network.
2. **Ground Layer**: A network of ground stations and gateways that connect to the orbital layer.
3. **Protocol Layer**: The software stSee the [full architecture documentation](docs/PROJECT.md) for detailed information.
